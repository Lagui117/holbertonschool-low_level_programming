# C - Structures, typedef

## 📚 Description

This project introduces two fundamental concepts in the C programming language:

- **Structures (`struct`)** – to group multiple related variables into a custom data type.
- **`typedef`** – to create aliases for existing data types, improving code readability.

You’ll learn how to define, use, and manipulate structured data like a `dog`, including dynamic allocation and memory cleanup.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without relying on Google:

- What structures are, when and why to use them
- How to declare and initialize a `struct`
- How to use pointers to structures
- How to use `typedef` to simplify code
- How to dynamically allocate and free memory for structures

## ⚙️ Compilation

All programs are compiled using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
