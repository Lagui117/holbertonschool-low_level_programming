# C - Recursion

## üìö Description

This project introduces the concept of **recursion** in C programming.  
You'll learn how to write functions that call themselves, understand when it's appropriate to use recursion, and how to avoid common mistakes like infinite recursion or stack overflows.

All functions must be implemented **without using loops**, and must follow **Betty coding style**.  
You are **not allowed to use standard library functions** like `printf`, `puts`, `strlen`, etc.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What recursion is
- How to implement recursion in C
- When to use recursion instead of loops
- When **not** to use recursion

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with `gcc` and flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Each file must end with a new line
- All your functions must be in the `main` function file unless specified
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- No global variables, no static variables
- You must use `putchar` (provided), and you cannot use the standard C library
- All function prototypes must go in the `main.h` header file
